# Spec-Driven Development

This directory stores artifacts from AI-assisted feature development using spec-driven development methodology.

## Purpose

Spec-driven development guides AI code generation through structured specifications, leading to more successful implementations. These artifacts help with feature iteration, understanding implementation decisions, and replicating similar work.

## Usage

1. **Directory Structure**: Create subdirectories using format `000-short-name` for each feature/initiative
2. **File Organization**: Place all related spec artifacts within the subdirectory 
3. **File Format**: Prefer [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for text files
4. **Maintenance**: Specs are point-in-time artifacts - they are not maintained or used in automation
