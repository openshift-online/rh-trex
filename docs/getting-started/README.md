# Getting Started with TRex

TRex is Red Hat's **T**rusted **R**est **EX**ample - a production-ready microservice template for rapid API development.

## What is TRex?

TRex provides a complete foundation for building enterprise-grade REST APIs with built-in best practices. It demonstrates a full CRUD implementation using "dinosaurs" as example business logic that you replace with your own domain models.

## Choose Your Path

### üèóÔ∏è I Want to Create a New Microservice
**‚Üí [Template Cloning](../template-cloning/)**

Perfect if you're starting a new project. TRex will clone itself into a new project with all the plumbing already set up.

**Time Investment:** 10-15 minutes  
**Result:** Complete new microservice ready for your business logic

### üîß I Want to Add Entities to an Existing TRex Project  
**‚Üí [Entity Development](../entity-development/)**

Great if you already have a TRex-based project and want to add new business objects (entities) with full CRUD operations.

**Time Investment:** 5 minutes per entity  
**Result:** Complete API, service, and database layers for your entity

### üéØ I Want to Explore TRex Locally
**‚Üí [Local Development](../operations/local-development.md)**

Best if you want to understand how TRex works before committing to using it for a project.
