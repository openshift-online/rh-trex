# Implement Structured Proposals Process for TRex

## Summary

This proposal introduces a formal proposals process for TRex to provide structured review of significant changes, features, and architectural decisions before implementation.

## Motivation

TRex currently lacks a formal process for proposing and discussing major changes. This creates challenges when multiple contributors want to suggest significant modifications or when architectural decisions need community input and documentation.

## Proposal

Create a `docs/proposals/` directory with a structured process where contributors submit proposals for review via pull requests. When proposals are merged, they are considered accepted and can proceed to implementation. The process includes a standard template with Summary, Motivation, Proposal, Implementation Plan, and Resources sections.

## Implementation Plan

Add proposals directory structure with README documentation, proposal template, and images directory for diagrams. Update contributing documentation to reference the new process. Use YYYYMMDD-proposal.md naming convention for proposal files.

## Resources

Based on established patterns from Kubernetes CAPI provider proposals: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/tree/main/docs/proposal
