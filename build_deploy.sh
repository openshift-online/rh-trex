# This script builds the UHC clusters service image, and pushes it to the
# registry. In order to work it needs the following variables defined in the
# CI/CD configuration of the project:
#
# QUAY_USER - The name of the robot account used to push images to 'quay.io',
# for example 'openshift-unified-hybrid-cloud+jenkins'.
#
# QUAY_TOKEN - The token of the robot account used to push images to 'quay.io'.
#
# The machines that run this script need to have access to internet, so that the
# built images can be pushed to quay.io.

# Prepare the environment:
if [ ! -z "${WORKSPACE}" ]; then
  source jenkins/environment.sh
fi

# The version should be the short git hash:
VERSION="$(git log --pretty=format:'%H' -n 1 | head -c 7)"

# Log in to the image registry:
if [ -z "${QUAY_USER}" ]; then
  echo "The 'quay.io' push user name hasn't been provided."
  echo "Make sure to set the 'QUAY_USER' environment variable."
  exit 1
fi
if [ -z "${QUAY_TOKEN}" ]; then
  echo "The 'quay.io' push token hasn't been provided."
  echo "Make sure to set the 'QUAY_TOKEN' environment variable."
  exit 1
fi
podman login -u "${QUAY_USER}" -p "${QUAY_TOKEN}" quay.io

# Push the image:
make \
  version="${VERSION}" \
  external_image_registry="quay.io" \
  image_repository="app-sre/ocm-example-service" \
  push
